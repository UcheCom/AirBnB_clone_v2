# Project: 0x02. AirBnB clone - MySQL

# Group Project: AirBnB clone - MySQL project is a collaboration between Uchenna Oko and Joy Chinwendu, students of Software Engineering of ALXSE program cohort 15. The aim of the project is to build a clone of the AirBnB website. This stage implements a backend interface, or console, to manage program data. Console commands allow the user to create, update, and destroy objects, as well as manage file storage.
